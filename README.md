You are allowed to read all the codes and files, but you are not allowed to copy directly for your assignments!!!!!!! I will not take any responsibility if you break the honor rule.      
Please try yourself and have fun working on those interesting projects! 


## Courese Informationï¼š
1. Course: ECE 438 Networking at UIUC
2. Time: 2018/08/271- 2018/12/15 
3. Teacher: Romit Roy Choudhury  (I HAVE TO SAY: I LIKE ROMIT SOOOOO MUCH!) I learned three semesters for computer networking, but it's tooooo difficult to understand about those complicated layers and protocols. While Romit make those boring and hard stuff interesting and easy to understand! I will definitely recommand this course for all ECE&CS students at UIUC!
